Introduction

This repository is dedicated to numerical modelling studies, particularly solving the Stokes equation using the Fenics library in Python. Fenics is an open-source computing platform for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The examples included here demonstrate the application of linear finite element methods to solve the Stokes equation.

Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Fenics
NumPy
Matplotlib
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/numerical-modelling.git
Navigate to the project directory:

sh
cd numerical-modelling-fenics
(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

sh
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
