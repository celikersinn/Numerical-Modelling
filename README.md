# Numerical-Modelling with Fenics

Welcome to the repository for my studies on numerical modelling using the Fenics library in Python. This repository contains various codes and examples focusing on solving partial differential equations (PDEs). These studies are part of the numerical modelling course at Politecnico di Milano, including lab studies and exam questions, all conducted on Google Colab which is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use.
